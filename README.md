# 📝 To-Do List CLI App

A simple, modular **Command-Line To-Do List** application built in **Python** with **Poetry**, managing all data **in-memory** (for now 👀).  
This app helps you create, edit, and organize projects and their tasks — all from your terminal.

> ⚡ **Next Phase:** Database integration is planned — to persist all projects and tasks between sessions!

## ✨ Features

### 🗂 Project Management
- Create new projects with name and description limits  
- Edit existing projects safely with validation

- View all projects with creation time ordering  

### ✅ Task Management
- Add new tasks under projects  
- Edit task description, deadline, and status  
- Change task status (`todo → doing → done`) with proper flow validation  
- Delete tasks by ID with success/error feedback  
- Display all tasks of a project with details

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Poetry** for dependency & environment management
- **In-Memory storage** (Phase 1)
- **Database support (Coming Soon 🚀)** in the next phase  
- **Modular architecture** — clear separation of logic (models, managers, cli)
